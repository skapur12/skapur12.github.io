  <p> My brother, currently, a senior in high school, is applying to colleges, and he once complained to me that it was 
    difficult to keep track of all of the requirements for each college. I decided to help him out by compiling all of the 
    required information for undergraduate admission for most colleges in North Carolina (since I’m from there) onto 
    one website. </p>
  <p> Designed and created using <b>Squarespace</b>, each page includes information about essays, letters of recommendation, 
    standardized testing, and much more! </p>

  <h2> Travel Troopers </h2>
 </div>
 <div class="description">
   <p> During the summer of 2018, I studied abroad in Barcelona, Spain. While there, I took a course entitled 
    Human-Computer Interaction: User Interface Design. For our class project, my team and I designed prototypes of a mobile 
    application and an augmented reality flexible map interface. </p>
  <p> These two interfaces helped groups traveling abroad locate restaurants based on recommendations from their friends, 
    provided directions to unfamiliar locations, and allowed people to chat and share photos from their trips. In essence, 
    it is sort of like an integration of the functionalities of Yelp Reviews and Slack Chat and Snapchat maps. </p>

     <p> This poster displays three possible prototypes of interfaces that could meet use to meet our objectives: facilitating 
      communication amongst friends, giving people recommendations regarding local restaurants, etc. etc. </p>
      <p> After receiving feedback from our classmates (part of our user group—as they were also students studying abroad), we 
      narrowed down the ideas presented here and used that information to create our next poster. </p>

     <p> This poster displays our final product: an app combined with an augmented reality map interface. Although the two are 
        marketed in combination, either one will work well to serve users’ needs in foreign environments! </p>

  <h2> Pothole Reporting System </h2>
</div>
<div class="description">
  <p> I designed a mobile application for a pothole reporting system. Using this app, cities can efficiently repair potholes 
    by prioritizing the larger ones, the older ones, the ones on busy roads, the more dangerous ones, etc. for repair. </p>
  <p> The city can then schedule a repair crew to take care of the pothole as quickly as possible. People can also take 
    report potholes by photographing them and uploading them to the app, or shouting “Pothole!” once they hit one on a road, 
    so that the location of the pothole can be tracked. The repair statuses of potholes around the city can be viewed on 
    the app as well. </p>
  <p> Click on the button below to see the full report and prototype of the app screens! </p>
