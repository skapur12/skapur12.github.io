Hi there! It’s me, Sanjana, back again, this time with some tips on landing your first software engineering internship! I recently went through this process and learned quite a few things along the way. In this post, I’ll give you a few tips on landing one of these internships.
Tip 1: Write a Cover Letter!
The cover letter is a way to differentiate yourself from all of the other candidates applying for that same job. Many, many people will often apply for a job posted online, so a well-crafted cover letter can set you apart from the sea of qualified candidates. It is also a good way to show that you’re truly interested in this company and are not just throwing your resume at any company and seeing what sticks.
Here are some tips for formatting a cover letter:
Before writing anything, write the date and company address at the top of the page. Address it to the person who will be reading the letter; if you don’t know their name, then you can write “Dear Hiring Manager.”
Paragraph 1: Introduce yourself by stating your major, year and school, reiterate the position that you’re applying for, and write 4–5 sentences on what interests you specifically about this position and why you want to work there. (Hint: Look at the job posting for help on this last part!)
Paragraph 2: Talk about your coursework and projects and the relevant experience/knowledge that they gave you. Elaborate on any details that you couldn’t include in your resume.
Paragraph 3: Wrap it up by stating why the company should hire you and how you think you can contribute to the company’s mission.
Final sentence: Leave email and phone number so they can contact you if necessary!
Tip 2: Know Your Stuff!
Make sure to brush up on your Object-Oriented Programming concepts. In particular, make sure you can explain the four principles of OOP: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism!
Also, make sure to practice technical questions commonly asked in interviews. CTCI (Cracking the Coding Interview) is a great place to start. As a note, when going through the questions in that book, write your solutions down on paper first, and then type them in your IDE of choice and check for errors.
Tip 3 : The Early Bird Gets the Worm!
When it comes to applying, the earlier, the better. I remember having the misconception that you should wait to add personal projects and class projects before searching for an internship. But that’s not the case. Apply early, because the early bird really does get the worm.
Remember that it’s okay if you’ve started a project but haven’t finished it! Make sure to put the source code on GitHub so that recruiters can easily see the progress you’ve made so far.
Tip 4: Network!
If possible, try to get a mentor in the computer science field to guide you through the industry. My dad is mine, and he’s helped me quite a bit. For context, he’s a software engineer and he owns his own business, so he was able to give me valuable insight on what it’s like on the other side of the hiring table and how he chooses candidates.
However, if you aren’t in contact with such a person, that’s okay. You’ll make more connections as you advance in the industry and be able to learn from them! Just talk to your peers in classes, computer science clubs, and the like. My point is, don’t go through the process alone!
Tip 5: Thank Your Interviewers!
Remember to thank the people who interviewed you. You can send them a text message, email, LinkedIn message, or even a written note!
If you have an in-person or onsite interview, ask for a business card at the end of the interview so that you can easily send your interviewer a message. It’s even better if you can send in a handwritten note! It’ll indirectly show how passionate you are about this role, and it’ll probably make your recruiter’s day. :)
Tip 6: Don’t Lose Hope!
The process of trying to land an internship can be extremely tiring and time-consuming. Don’t lose hope! Remember that there are tons of other students going through the same thing as you. I didn’t get one until my junior year. To me, it always seemed like everyone else was landing all these great opportunities as sophomores and even as freshmen while I was left out. But don’t worry! Keep putting in effort and your time will come!
Also, remember that it’s not the end of the world if you don’t get an internship. There are so many other things that you can do over your summer break. You could study abroad, take some summer classes, work at a summer job, work on a personal project, etc. etc.
Thanks for reading! If you made it this far, you deserve a cookie! 🍪 Good luck on that job search!
