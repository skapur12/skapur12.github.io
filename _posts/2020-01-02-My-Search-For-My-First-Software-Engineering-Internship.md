Before I get into the nitty-gritty details, let me start by introducing myself: Hi there! My name is Sanjana Kapur, and I’m a third-year Computer Science major at Georgia Tech. In this post, I’m going to be discussing how I landed my first software engineering internship. Let’s jump right in!

  <b> The Buildup  </b>
</div>

The semester of Spring 2019 was the one during which I first began to seriously look for an internship for the following summer. However, I didn’t branch out very far, as I applied to only twelve companies through CareerBuzz, my school’s job portal for students. I received one interview, and I utterly failed at that interview, as I was unable to solve the whiteboard question I was given. Although the question was relatively simple, I had never practiced solving ones like it before.

As it turns out, I didn’t find an internship for the summer of 2019, but I was not too worried. That summer, I went with my dad to his office every day and worked on a couple of personal projects there. Following several different tutorials, I built a few iOS apps and learned how to navigate Xcode. I also ventured into UX design and created a website that compiled information about various NC universities’ admissions processes.

Then, when my junior year of college began, I knew that it was time to get serious about my internship search.

  <b> The Actual Search </b>
</div>

Almost every morning, I attended Day In The Lobby Events. Representatives from tech companies would set up a booth in the lobby at Georgia Tech’s College of Computing building. The representatives took students’ resumes and answered our questions about their company’s internship programs. I recall spending quite a few hours each day standing in these lines every day, waiting for my turn to speak to a recruiter. Some of my closest friends today are ones I made by just turning to the people closest to me and striking up a conversation. Being able to get some one-on-one time speaking with the recruiter was quite informative. I was able to glean a lot of information about what the programs were like that I wouldn’t have been able to get online.

I also attended Tech Talks, corporate events that took place in the evening. Typically, the company representatives put on a PowerPoint presentation and gave us students information about what the company did, as well as their internship application process. What I found interesting was that they also often hosted workshops. Some companies gave us programming questions and allowed us to work together to come up with a viable solution. Others had workshops that taught us skills; one company walked us through a presentation teaching us how to create our own personal portfolio website. I was so inspired by that presentation that I indeed decided to use that information to create my own website a few days later!

And finally, I went to two Georgia Tech career fairs: the All-Majors fair, and the College of Computing fair. In previous years, I spent most of my time standing in extremely long lines just to talk to one or two well-known tech companies. However, this time, I decided to branch out a bit more and talk to as many companies as I possibly could, regardless of the prestige, just to get as much exposure as possible. I noticed myself growing more confident over time; the more I practiced speaking to recruiters, the more naturally my elevator pitch rolled off of my tongue, and the more relaxed I felt overall.

  <b> The Results </b>

Then, I sat down, wrote cover letters, and applied to forty-three companies’ software engineering internship programs. (All of these were companies I encountered at one of the aforementioned events.) I was sent several coding challenges via HackerRank and similar portals, and from there I traveled to a few on-site interviews.

Then one day, a recruiter at Norfolk Southern, a railway transportation company, contacted me. She set up a series of video conference interviews for me early the next morning so that I could talk to several different teams at the company the next day. Although I felt quite nervous in the hours leading up to that interview, I can say now, looking in hindsight, that the interviews were a great learning experience. All of my interviewers were very kind and patiently answered my plethora of questions about the products on which their teams were working. I also answered questions about my resume and several technical questions as well. Then, merely a few days later, I received a call with an offer for a Spring 2020 internship at the company!

  <b> Any Advice? </b>
</div>

Although it sounds cliche, I think that putting in consistent effort over the course of the semester really does pay off. During previous semesters, I was lazy and simply applied online to these companies without any sort of in-person interaction. I realized that I was cheating myself by not taking advantage of all of the wonderful events that allowed me to speak face-to-face with the recruiters and learn more about their companies’ internship programs. The time I spent alone practicing answering technical interview questions proved to be invaluable as well.
