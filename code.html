  <h2> Donation Tracker </h2>
 </div>
 <div class="description">
  <p> Alongside a few team members, I built an application in Android Studio using Java to help non-profit organizations 
    keep track of donations of goods. The app allowed organizations to track and categorize and categorize donations. It 
    tracked distribution and donation metrics, and it connected donation centers to each other to allow for redistribution of 
    goods (if necessary). </p>
  <p> This app followed a Model-View-Controller pattern. My teammates and I took turns working on each of the aspects each 
    week, so I helped develop the Model, the View, and the Controller. </p>
