     <h2> Attack of the Space Aliens </h2>
</div>
<div class="description">
     <p> Using <b>C</b>, I created a game for the GameBoy Advance called ‘Attack of the Space Aliens.’ The player controls a spaceship (which they can move left, right, 
          up, and down) and must press buttons to shoot bullets at aliens (both big and small) on the sides of the screen. </p>
     <p> The player must take all of the big aliens’ lives to win. The player will also lose a life if they are hit by an alien or they encounter a 
          yellow star. There are 3 levels in total. </p>
     <p> Below is a run-through of the game! </p>

  <h2> Donation Tracker </h2>
 </div>
 <div class="description">
      <p> Alongside a few team members, I built an application in <b>Android Studio</b> using <b>Java</b> to help non-profit 
      organizations keep track of donations of goods. The app allowed organizations to track and categorize and categorize 
      donations. It tracked distribution and donation metrics, and it connected donation centers to each other to allow for 
      redistribution of goods (if necessary). </p>
      <p> This app followed a <b>Model-View-Controller</b> pattern. My teammates and I took turns working on each of the 
      aspects each week, so I helped develop the Model, the View, and the Controller. </p>

  <h2> <a href= "https://skapur12.github.io/" class="nav-link"> Personal Website </a> </h2>
 </div>
  <div class="description">
       <p> I’m including this website on the list! I created it in GitHub Pages using <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. As you can 
         see, it contains my resume, descriptions of projects (both code-based and design-based) that I’ve done, links to my 
         profiles, and my blog. </p>
    <p> I created a default layout that can be applied to every page, which simplifies my task quite a bit! Instead of 
         duplicating the same code on every page, I can simply use this layout to place the same tabs at the top of the 
         page and icons at the bottom of the page. </p>
       <p> I also used <b>Markdown</b> (<b>Kramdown</b> specifically) and <b>Jekyll</b> to create my blog and integrate it 
       onto this site. (More posts are coming soon!) Thanks to these handy tools, I can write my blog posts in a plain text 
       file and hit publish, and they’ll take care of all of the formatting for me. </p>
       <p> Lastly, I used <b>JavaScript</b> to add a <b>Disqus</b> comment section into each blog. Now, it incorporates all 
       of the features of Disqus (tweeting/sharing posts, reacting to posts, and commenting)! </p>
